      **Reliability, Fairness, and Causal Inference (The "Current" Identity)**

      Staff Research Scientist (promoted from Senior RS) in the Central Applied Science (CAS) team. I lead the development of foundational machine learning methodologies that solve critical business challenges.

      In large-scale industrial systems, predictive accuracy on average is insufficient. We need models that are calibrated across all subpopulations and robust to distribution shifts. My work on Multicalibration (MCGrad) and Causal Inference aims to build the mathematical foundations for this next generation of reliable AI.

      I also facilitate academic collaboration by hosting PhD interns, publishing findings, and defining research proposals for the academic community.

      **Key Projects:**
      *   **MCGrad:** Lead researcher on [MCGrad](https://mcgrad.dev/), a project on Multicalibration at Web Scale.

      **Adversarial ML & Fraud Detection (The "Applied" Identity)**

      Real-world data is not i.i.d. It is often adversarial. At Booking.com, I led the research and engineering of fraud detection systems that had to adapt to rapidly changing attack vectors (Concept Drift). This experience grounded my research in the engineering realities of high-stakes, low-latency environments.

      *   Reduced stolen credit card fraud by 85%.
      *   Engineering focused role with end-to-end model ownership from idea generation to implementation, monitoring, and maintenance.
      *   Developed and instructed internal courses on Causal Inference and Process Mining.
      *   Led research initiatives in concept drift detection.
      *   Utilized a stack including (Py)Spark, Hive, and Vowpal Wabbit to build scalable ML solutions.

      **Process Mining & Sequence Modeling (The "Foundational" Identity)**

      Before the current wave of Generative AI, I pioneered the use of Deep Learning for understanding business processes. My work on Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks for Predictive Business Process Monitoring was among the first to bridge the gap between Process Mining and Deep Learning, allowing organizations to predict process outcomes with unprecedented accuracy.

      *   Completed a joint PhD project at TU Eindhoven and Philips Research.
      *   Authored 30 peer-reviewed articles.
