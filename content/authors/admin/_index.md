I am a Staff Research Scientist and Tech Lead in the Central Applied Science (CAS) team at Meta. My research bridges the gap between scientific rigor and real-world impact, focusing on foundational challenges in machine learning and data science. I lead collaborative initiatives that drive value across Meta's products while maintaining active engagement with the academic community.

Previously, I held research and engineering roles at Booking.com and Philips Research, where I specialized in fraud detection, sequence modeling, and process mining.

I have authored over 35 peer-reviewed publications, garnering more than 2,500 citations with an h-index of 21. I am deeply committed to the academic community, serving on Program Committees for top-tier conferences such as NeurIPS, FAccT, and BPM, and mentoring PhD interns. My teaching experience includes internal courses on causal inference and machine learning.
