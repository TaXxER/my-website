I am a Staff Research Scientist at Meta (Central Applied Science), where I lead research on the foundations of reliable Machine Learning. My work focuses on Multicalibration, Causal Inference, and Process Mining, bridging the gap between theoretical guarantees and the engineering realities of web-scale systems. Previously, I worked on fraud detection at Booking.com and led research on concept drift. I am the author of 35+ peer-reviewed papers with over 2,500 citations.

**Research Interests:**
*   **Reliability & Fairness:** Multicalibration, Uncertainty Quantification, Active Learning.
*   **Sequence Modeling:** Process Mining, RNNs, Temporal Point Processes.
*   **Causal Inference:** Causal Discovery, Treatment Effect Estimation, Interleaving.
